# gabor-neurons
Simulating a simple cell with a vertical receptive field and half-wave squaring nonlinear ouput.

The function used for the simple cell was Gabor.

The figures below compare the actual receptive field (RF) of the cell with the spike train average-derived
RF (based on Gaussian white noise images).

The first figure is the cell's RF seen directly (clearly Gabor). The second is the cell's RF reverse-computed using output to Gaussian white noise (we can see the Gaborness).
